We understand that privacy is important to our users and we do our best to address this issue.
In this first blog post we would like to explain what we do to achieve this goal. 

### What we do:

* We try to minimize the use of external resources like *Google Web Fonts* which some people believe could cause privacy issues.
The only external resources we use are:
	* the jQuery framework from jquery.com (MaxCDN),
	* the Wistia player, 
	* and reCaptcha from Google for a few pages (sign up, password reset, report comment modal).
* Because we don't display ads we also don't have to embed content from questionable ad networks that track your online behavior.
* StackDB doesn't require an email address for sign up if you log in with a social account and if you do give us your email address we only store a [hash value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of it in our database. This means that we cannot send you any emails unless you re-enter your email address every time.
* We never use IP addresses to identify specific users.

### Where we can improve:

* We're still using Google services like *reCaptcha* because we didn't find any good alternatives. However, it shouldn't be too big of a problem for registered users because it's only used on the few pages mentioned above. 
* Because we are using multiple *cloud providers* to host stackDB, we cannot guarantee you a fully IP-logging free service.

We know that some of our decisions aren't perfect but they are sometimes necessary due to our very limited resources. If you have ideas how we can improve stackDB, please [let us know](https://stackdb.net/contact).
