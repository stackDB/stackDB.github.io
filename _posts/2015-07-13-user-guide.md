## How To Search For Stacks

One of our goals is to make the supplement stacks easily searchable. That's why we have implemented the *Smart Search* function. There are three different different types of things you can search for.

1. **Supplements**
1. **Tags** (think of it as categories)
1. **Full-Text** (search for a word in the stack's description and title)

## How To Post A Stack

StackDB is a user-oriented platform which means that it's up to the users how to use it; nevertheless, we would like to recommend a few things that we believe will improve the usability of our site.

1. **Title:** Try to find a unique and meaningful. Don't use special characters to make it stand out. 
1. **Supplements:** Always try to use the suggested supplements instead of creating you own. This makes it easier for users to find your stack based on specific supplements. If you use a special form or type of supplement please add it to the comments. This is very important because it has to be clear to which type of supplement the dosage information refers to. Same goes for any special form of administration (e.g. sublingual). ![Search](/public/img/supplement-ex.png)
1. **Description:** Here you can write about the purpose of your stack, share your experience, and explain the decisions you made. You can use the *markdown syntax* to format the text. Learn more about here: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). If you want to use embedded images in your description please contact us.
1. **Links:** It's allowed to link to (commercial) websites but please disclosure if you have any financial interest in the product you are linking to. All links posted by users are *nofollow* by default. 
1. **Tags:** It's unnecessary to use supplement as tags. Think of them as way to categorize the stack. The goals of your stack are a great way to start. If it's possible please use suggested tags to avoid duplicates.
